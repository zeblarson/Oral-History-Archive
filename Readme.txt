Project: Anti-Apartheid Movement Oral History Archive

Description

Digital history is becoming an increasingly common way to present and study history: 
it allows a much larger segment of the public to view these materials, but by 
assembling them, scholars can study materials in novel ways. While digital history 
projects around the anti-apartheid movement have proliferated, few work to capture 
oral histories, or collect them from around the web. This project will allow users
to find and listen to audio recordings along with transcripts, will provide 
information on hosted audio recordings, and will collect information on other 
repositories.
