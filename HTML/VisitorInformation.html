        <p>
            This website's purpose is to collect oral histories and interviews from those who were involved
            in the global anti-apartheid movement. If you participated in boycotts, support groups, protests,
            or anything else, we'd like to hear from you. Please submit some information about yourself in the 
            form below so that we can contact you to set up a potential interview.
        </p>
        <p>
            By agreeing to an interview, you consent to have the interview be recorded and be publicly available. 
            Participation in the interview is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time should you not wish to 
            proceed.
