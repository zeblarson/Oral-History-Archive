        <h1 id="header">Anti-Apartheid Movement Oral History Archive</h1>
        <p id="introduction">This website is intended to bring together oral histories that relate to the 
            global anti-apartheid movement. At the moment, the interviews mostly deal with 
            the anti-apartheid movement in the United States, but over time materials will 
            be added from all over the world. Visitors can search for interviews, read summaries
            of the interviews, download or listen to the audio, and view transcripts where they
            are available.

            <h2>Importance of the Anti-Apartheid Movement</h2>
                <p>Opposition to South African apartheid became one of the most important human rights
            campaigns of the twentieth-century. The brutality and racism of the apartheid system
            created solidarity campaigns all over the world aimed at forcing the South African
            government to treat its citizens with basic human rights, offer economic justice, and 
            ultimately create a multiracial democracy. This work took decades, both inside and
            outside of South Africa.

                </p>
                <p>In South Africa, activists worked to undermine apartheid laws, challenge the South
            African government, and undermine their control over the country. Outside of the country,
            exiles and supporters worked to weaken the apartheid government through boycotts, divestment,
            material support for the liberation movements, and protests over their home government's support
            or tolerance for the South African government. Over time, these movements isolated South Africa
            from the rest of the world and weakened its economy at the same time that those resisting 
            apartheid within South Africa put increasing pressure on the government to reform. Ultimately,
            and with a great deal of sacrifice, this movement brought about the end of apartheid and 
            multiracial elections in 1994, bringing democracy to South Africa.

            <h2>Why This History Matters</h2>
                <p>
                Docucmenting this history is vitally important. Rarely have struggles for human rights
                taken on global proportions, and the anti-apartheid movement lasted for decades despite
                all the challenges in sustaining such a campaign. Moreover, the grassroots nature of this 
                movement needs to be better understood. In the United States, there was no single 
                anti-apartheid movement: different groups worked at the city and state level, meaning that
                there are hundreds of different stories that need to be understood. Because this movement
                was so decentralized, these histories are at risk of being lost as the physical records
                disappear and people's recollections are not captured.
                </p>
                <p>
                The anti-apartheid movement also can supply lessons to a host of similar movements today.
                Creating a historical record that can be studied and mined for inspiration can be used by
                contemporary activists for their own struggles.
